                <p>A biblical counselor's work is one part of the overall project of building the church toward maturity and attaining the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. In counseling, there is always a temptation to problem-solve and “fix” people's lives. Yet the end goal of biblical counseling is spiritual growth. Biblical counseling seeks to reorient disordered desires, affections, thoughts, behaviors, and worship toward a God-designed anthropology in an effort to restore people to a right fellowship with God and others.</p>

                <p>The mission of the music, worship, and creative arts ministry shall be to glorify God, for God to speak to us, and to edify each other. The Purpose of the music, worship, and creative arts ministry is to help provide an atmosphere, which is agreeable and comfortable to worship. 1. Music in the church is a form of communication that instructs the people of God (we are to “teach and admonish” one another by means of music). 2. Music in the church is an act of sincere, spiritual worship (that is, our singing should be an authentic expression of thanks and praise 'to God with our hearts').</p>

                <p>Church media's purpose is to transmit messages, disseminate information, and facilitate worship, outreach, and interaction with both members and the wider community.

Their goal is to enable your church's message to reach a broader audience beyond your doors and even your regular service times. The mission of Media Ministry is, to capture, communicate, and present God's message through various medium and/or platforms with the intent of Making, Marking, Maturing and Mending disciples to Evangelize the world.</p>
